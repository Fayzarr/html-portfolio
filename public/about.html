<h1>About Me</h1>

  I was born and raised in scotland 25 years ago and lived there until i was 9 years old when my parents made the decision to move
  to Australia! I have lived in Australia for 16 years now and wouldnt want to live anywhere else. The sunny weather and beaches 
  make for great days out and the people here are amazing.

  I recently decieded to quit the factory job i had and travel all of europe which was amazing, i went to 20 different countries over  
  8 months and i learnt so many different things about other people and their cultures but i also learnt alot about myself. Once i flew back to Australia
  i realised that i didin't want to work in a factory anymore and i wanted to do something i enjoyed which brings me to now. I have been learning how to code 
  for a few months now and haven't looked back since, this is my first ever website that i have created and i cant wait to look back at it in a few years time to 
  see where i came from and how much i have grown as a developer!
